# WIPOS
This OS is my first crack at making one from scratch
You will see just how much this OS could change over the course of its lifespan

Thanks!

P.S. and to those people from the osdev wiki, cut me some slack pls...


**GENERAL SERVICE ANNOUCEMENT**
As of the 30th of August 2022, I have decided to temporarily halt all developement on WIPOS. This decision was made because I would like to focus on other projects and generally grow as a coder before re-tackling this project. My apologies to anyone expecting any progress, however you may expect many more projects in html and C++ coming soon!

Thank You for your kind patience and generosity!
